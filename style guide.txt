Carefully read the preamble/operators[preamble].tex. This contains everything we have macro'd and we will require the usage of said macros to ensure that things are easier to change globally.

For things like log, Re etc, the commands were already defined so its not in the operator preamble. So use \log, \Re etc wherever appropriate.

use `` '' for quotations.

always use \[\] for displaymode instead of $$ $$

don't use \left \right, use \big \Big \bigg \Bigg for the correct sizes.

Use \xoverline, \xhat and \xtilde for the respective operations.

Use the environments for e.g. theorems or lemmas

Use \begin{equation}\tag{8.1} [insert eqn here] \end{equation} for equation 8.1 for example

The citations are done, use \cite{} to cite things from the bibliography.

The numbering in this paper is easy fortunately. Here is what we will do: label each theorem/lemma just its number as it appears in the format \label{x.x} so theorem 8.1. is going to become \label{8.1}, and 1.12. would become \label{1.12}. Similarly for equations add parenthesis, so equation 8.1 is \label{(8.1)}. If you see these while typing, use \ref{} to reference these. so an excerpt
"from equation (8.1) we can see ...." will become "from equation (\ref{(8.1)}) we can see ...."

The prime ideal of K is a mathfrak p, use \p or \mathfrak{p} for it.

Use mathbb for R,Q and C.
