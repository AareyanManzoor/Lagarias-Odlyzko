Hello everyone, this is where to claim sections. Pick one section at a time, if you complete your section then you can indicate it and pick another section. This is a smaller project, so lets try to get the first typesetting done by 24th october.

pick a section example:
``sec 1 (409-417): Aareyan ''
done section example:
``sec 1 (409-417): Aareyan %done'' 
Feel free to ask for help with sections in this document and also on the discord.

There is a latex scan in mathpix.tex, a latex scan of this paper. Feel free to use these to aid your work.

Please READ THE STYLE GUIDE before starting any typing.
